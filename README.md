# Graph-Components

This repository contains a Bar Chart component for Winforms. IThis component started life as something quick 
and simple I needed for a project - everything I found online at that time was either too big and complex
(read: I was lazy and did not want to learn how to use them) or required registration or some such. So I did
what all smartypants-developers do: I made my own.

The component is super simple and not fancy by any means. It can only do bar charts for now, but I have some
variations that I'm working on and will probably publish at a later time, if I get them to work well enough.

The repository contains a sample app and the actual component. The component is a single file, "BarChartGraphic.cs",
which you just plonk on to your Winforms app and use. No packages, no installers, no nothing.

Do whatever you want with it.

## Test project

There are no tests at the moment; the test project is something I'm stuck with. I'd like to test the 
calculations of the drawing, but it's all private stuff and I don't know how much effort I want to 
put into surfacing it. Maybe later, gator.
